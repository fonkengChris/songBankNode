  "authorName": " Caroline M. Noel",
  "description": "This  is a classic Christian hymn that emphasizes the authority, majesty, and exaltation of Jesus Christ. The lyrics were written by Caroline M. Noel in 1870 and are based on Philippians 2:9-11, which speaks of every knee bowing at the name of Jesus and every tongue confessing His lordship. The hymn reflects on the power of Jesus' name and encourages believers to honor, worship, and recognize Christ's sovereignty.\nThe hymn's melody is often set to Ralph Vaughan Williams' tune, \"King's Weston,\" which adds a dignified and reverent tone to the text. The verses celebrate themes of Jesus' incarnation, sacrifice, triumph, and eventual return, making it a popular choice in liturgical settings, particularly during feasts of Christ the King, Ascension, and other celebrations of Jesus' lordship.",

  "description": "\"You Are Mine\" by David Haas is a contemporary Christian hymn widely cherished for its comforting and uplifting message. Composed in 1991, it is part of Haas's extensive collection of liturgical music, often used in Catholic and Christian worship services.\n\nThe song's lyrics are inspired by biblical themes, particularly God's assurance of love, comfort, and presence to His people. Passages like Isaiah 43:1-5 and Matthew 11:28-30 echo in the lyrics, where God reassures believers: \"Do not be afraid, I am with you.\" These sentiments form the core of the hymn's message, emphasizing God's unwavering love, care, and guidance.\n\nMusically, \"You Are Mine\" is characterized by a gentle, melodic structure that enhances its reflective and prayerful tone. Its repetitive and meditative nature makes it accessible for congregational singing while fostering a sense of peace and spiritual connection.\n\nThe hymn has been embraced not only in religious settings but also in moments of personal reflection, funerals, and other events where themes of hope and divine love are needed. Its enduring popularity is a testament to its profound resonance with people seeking solace and reassurance in their faith.",
